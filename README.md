If you would like to open the application in a simulated iphone, first open xcode simulation, then run:

```bash
- npm run ios
```

If you would like to use the expo go app for development, use:

```bash
npm start

Then navigate to your application (make sure you are on the same wifi), scan the QR code, then open up your application.
